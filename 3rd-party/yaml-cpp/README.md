# yaml-cpp

> This directory is a tini build of yaml-cpp.

yaml-cpp is a [YAML](http://www.yaml.org/) parser and emitter in C++ matching the [YAML 1.2 spec](http://www.yaml.org/spec/1.2/spec.html).

To get a feel for how it can be used, see the [Tutorial](https://github.com/jbeder/yaml-cpp/wiki/Tutorial) or [How to Emit YAML](https://github.com/jbeder/yaml-cpp/wiki/How-To-Emit-YAML). For the old API (version < 0.5.0), see [How To Parse A Document](https://github.com/jbeder/yaml-cpp/wiki/How-To-Parse-A-Document-(Old-API)).

# How to Build #

1. Download and install [GNU Make](http://www.cmake.org) (Downloading Make).

2. Navigate into this directory.

3. Extract the source directory from "yaml-cpp-0.7.0.tar.gz" package to this directory:

    ```sh
    tar xvzf yaml-cpp-0.7.0.tar.gz yaml-cpp-yaml-cpp-0.7.0/src/ --strip-components 1
    ```

4. Build it!
    ```sh
    make
    ```

5. To clean up, just remove the `build` directory.
    ```sh
    make clean
    ```

To install the library archive for that can be referenced:

```
make install
```

## In short:

```sh
# extract the source code
tar xvzf yaml-cpp-0.7.0.tar.gz yaml-cpp-yaml-cpp-0.7.0/src/ --strip-components 1
# build and install
make install
```
