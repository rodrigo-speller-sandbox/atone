Description: Atone is a Linux init-like process supervisor.
 Atone is a tool for defining, running and monitoring
 single/multi-service Linux containers processes. With Atone, you can
 use a YAML file to configure your container's services. Then, with a
 single command, you start all the services from your configuration.
